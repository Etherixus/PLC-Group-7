This is For Phase 4

HOW TO RUN
Jott.Java is the main file and will be the exeacutable.
within this file you must give one system arg and one only.
The one argument must be a .jott file and the absloute path works best

Example path: C:\Users\conno\PLC-Group-7\phase3testcases\reallyLong.jott
The above path is put in the CLI field of the run config.
To run a different file, make sure the code is not running and enter a different file
